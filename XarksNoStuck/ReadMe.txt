This mod resolves the issue in Army Assault where a round can start with no players online, forcing anyone who joins to wait until the round ends.

Basically a fix for that damn minimum_player they wont do anything about.

The mod checks if the required number of players is met before a round begins.

If the requirement isn't met, the mod automatically rotates the map, ensuring that rounds only start when players are available to participate.

This is basically just a reupload of Wrexials old mod with a few changes to the script. He did all the work, I just changed like 2 things.
